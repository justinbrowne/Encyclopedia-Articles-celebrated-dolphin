# blockquote

*A section that is quoted from another source.*  

The `<blockquote>` tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.  
Browsers usually indent `<blockquote>` elements.  

## Syntax  

The CSS property blockquote:  

#### Cite

URL of the quote, if it is taken from the web.  

```html
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 5 million globally.
</blockquote>

## Special Notes

Browsers generally render blockquote text as indented text. If your quoted text needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, you should use the HTML `<q>` tag. Most browsers surround `<q>` text with quotation marks.
